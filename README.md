# Machine Learning based Structural Health Assessment using RST invariant Features for SDNET18 dataset

Ensuring the safety and durability of concrete structures exposed to water is crucial, as these structures are susceptible to damage, with cracks being one of the most common issues. Cracks can lead to significant deterioration and potential structural failures. This project focuses on the automated detection of concrete cracks using the SDNET18 dataset, which includes cracks ranging in width from 0.06mm to 25mm. For feature extraction, Rotation-Scale-Translation(RST) invariant features were used alongside advanced image processing techniques, including high-boost spatial filtering, histogram equalization, edge detection, and morphological operations. A Support Vector Machine(SVM) classifier was then used for crack detection. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed method, key performance metrics including accuracy, the Receiver Operating Characteristic(ROC) curve, and the Area Under the Curve(AUC) score were analyzed. The results indicate the reliability of this approach in accurately identifying cracks in images of concrete structures.

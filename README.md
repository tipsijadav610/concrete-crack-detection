# Machine Learning based Structural Health Assessment using RST invariant Features for SDNET18 dataset

Ensuring the safety and durability of concrete structures exposed to water is essential, as cracks can lead to significant deterioration and potential structural failures. This project focuses on the automated detection of concrete cracks using the SDNET18 dataset, which includes cracks ranging from as narrow as 0.06 mm to as wide as 25 mm. The dataset also presents various real-world challenges, such as shadows, surface roughness, scaling, edges, holes, and background debris. In this study, we utilize Rotation-Scale-Translation (RST) invariant features along with advanced image processing techniques, including High Boost Spatial Filtering, Histogram Equalization, Edge Detection, and Morphological Operations, to effectively detect cracks. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is employed to distinguish between cracked and non-cracked images. We evaluate the performance of our proposed method using key metrics, such as accuracy, the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) score. These evaluations demonstrate the reliability of our approach in identifying cracks in concrete structures. By integrating sophisticated image processing techniques with cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, this project aims to enhance the capabilities of crack detection systems, contributing to safer and more resilient infrastructure.
